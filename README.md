# LEURN
Official Repository for LEURN: Learning Explainable Univariate Rules with Neural Networks
https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14937

Detailed information about LEURN is given in the presentations,
A demo is provided for training, making local explanations and data generation in DEMO.py

Main difference of this implementation from the paper:
- LEURN is now much simpler and uses binarized tanh (k=1 always) with no degradation in performance.

Notes: 
- For top performance, a thorough hyperparameter search as described in paper is needed.
- Deepcause provides consultancy services to make the most out of LEURN
